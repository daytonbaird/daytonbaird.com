# My Personal Website - [daytonbaird.com](https://daytonbaird.com)

Built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Three.js, and Framer Motion.

I hacked this website togther over a weekend to learn Three.js and Framer Motion and to showcase my work. I followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k) on Three.js and then added my own personal touch to it. I also used Framer Motion to animate the page transitions and the text on the home page.
